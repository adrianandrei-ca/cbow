Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, invited her to supper. 
She replied it should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated. 
Our courteous Antony, whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.
